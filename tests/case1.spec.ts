  * Task : Your job is to rework the 1 test.

  * There is a 'API' call that gets made and the browser turns that backend value into a human readable label.
  * A test needs to be written that tests to make sure that the conversion is correct. The frontend hasn't been delievered yet
  * but a way to convert the backend type into a frontend type can be done in the meantime.
  * 
  * Notes:
  * The backend data can vary so make sure whatever value is returned by the backend will equal the expected frontend label
  * There are only ever 5 elements returned by the API
